# infinisketch

Every sketching app on the planet lets you draw and erase.
Fewer give you an infinite canvas.
Fewer can do it at a moment's notice.

This definitely isn't the last sketching app you'll need,
but hopefully the first.

## Basic use

There are four tools toggled by radio buttons:

- The pen tool draws solid lines
- The eraser removes entire strokes
- The move tool pans the canvas
- The zoom tool zooms by dragging up/down

The width of pen and eraser strokes is controlled by
the random unlabeled slider.
Colors are selected by setting coordinates on a fixed palette
using the sliders next to the palette.

## Palette

The fixed palette isn't just a bad trick that
makes it easier for me to write the rendering code.
Coming soon, it's gonna enable all sorts of cool features
like theming and color cycling.

## Keyboard

Intended use is drawing with one hand,
and operating keyboard controls with the other.
The tools are mapped (in order) to the keys ASDF.
Press and hold to use a tool, and release to go straight back to the pen tool.
Horizontal palette coordinate can be set by number keys 1-8.
